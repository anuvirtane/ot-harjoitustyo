Preparations (d8) :


1. Soak black beans overnight in enough water (beans expand about 3 times their dried size) 
2. On day 9, discard soaking water and impurities. Replace with fresh water - enough to cover the beans by at least 10cm - add herbs, onion and garlic chunks for taste. Bring to a boil and let simmer, covered, until the beans are soft (takes about an hour, but keep an eye on them from around 45min). Make sure they’re always covered by water. Set aside and cover until cooking time or discard water and refrigerate in a container.
