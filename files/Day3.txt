Preparations (d1-d2) :


1. On day 1, soak chickpeas overnight
2. On day 2, discard soaking water and impurities. Replace with fresh water - enough to cover the peas by at least 10cm. Bring to a boil, then discard the water again or, if you have time, let sit, covered, for an hour before discarding the water.
3. Fill with fresh water, enough to cover the peas by 2cm, add a bit of salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat to let simmer lightly for 1h or so (the peas need to be tender). Save cooking water for day3 and let cool down before putting in the fridge, as with the chickpeas. 




Making Hummus (d3) :


1. Blend tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper and spices with some of the broth, set aside.
2. Blend chickpeas in batches in the blender along with the broth, being careful to keep a creamy texture. 
3. Mix it all together, adding water if needed to keep the texture. Correct with salt, lemon juice and spices as needed - you should get a smooth and fresh taste.


Decorate with paprika and/or parsley.
