Cooking:
Rinse the rice thoroughly: Pour the selected amount of dry rice in a large pot and cover with water; mix thoroughly. Discard the water by using a strainer. Repeat the operation once or twice. 
Prepare to cook: In a large enough pot, add about 1,5 times the quantity of rice in water. Bring to a boil over med-high to high heat. Reduce the heat and let simmer until the rice is done or all the water is absorbed. Cover and set aside for 5 min. 
You may also speed the process by covering tightly (add weight on the lid) from the beginning. If you do so, add a bit less water. Once you see steam coming out of the lid, let boil like so for 1 minute and reduce heat to minimum and let simmer until done. 
Mix well and serve
