Preparation and cooking (d5) :


1. Chop the onion, ginger and spices and fry carefully in oil until the onion turns glassy and soft.
2. Add tomato purée and keep frying
3. Meanwhile, melt the peanut butter in a separate saucepan over low heat, then add to the rest. 
4. Add the crushed tomatoes, soy sauce, lemon juice and water
5. Add salt and pepper and adjust to taste
6. You can add water if it becomes too thick or you need to extend the recipe a bit. Careful not to dilute too much though!


Note! Make sure not to burn the peanut butter while heating it up!


* Soy sauce is OK for gluten intolerance

Butter Beans
For these beans, use the full amount provided for this course. The preparation goes accordingly.




Preparation (d4):
1. Soak overnight in a large amount of water (they will expand a lot).




Cooking (d5):
1. Discard the soaking water and replace it with fresh tap water, enough to cover 10cm over the beans.
2. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat and let simmer for about 1h or until the beans are tender. If you so desire, add in chunks of onions and garlic and some herbs to the cooking water. 
3. Once done, drain out the liquid and let it cool down. Once cool, transfer into a container and refrigerate.


Before serving (d6):
* Check the taste. Add salt, pepper and perhaps a line of olive oil.
