Preparations (d0) :


1. Soak black beans overnight in enough water (beans expand about 3 times their dried size) 
2. On day 1, discard soaking water and impurities. Replace with fresh water - enough to cover the beans by at least 10cm - add herbs, onion and garlic chunks for taste. Bring to a boil and let simmer, covered, until the beans are soft (takes about an hour, but keep an eye on them from around 45min). Make sure they’re always covered by water. Set aside and cover until cooking time or discard water and refrigerate in a container. 




Cooking - stew (d2) :


1. Sauté onions and spices.
2. Add beans, crushed tomatoes, sesame seeds and corn. Add water if needed.
3. Bring to boil over med-high heat.
4. Reduce heat and let simmer. Check taste and correct with salt, pepper or spices.


Note (for any beans): If you forget to prepare the beans and need to cook them on the same day, simply bring the soaking water to a heavy boil for 2 min and then let sit for 1 or 2 hours. Discard the water, then proceed to cooking them as in step 2 and the following cooking method.

Cooking:


Rinse the rice thoroughly: Pour the selected amount of dry rice in a large pot and cover with water; mix thoroughly. Discard the water by using a strainer. Repeat the operation once or twice. 
Prepare to cook: Cover the rice with water (2-3 cm above the rice line). Add a bit of salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and let boil, uncovered, until you see little bubbly holes at the surface of the rice. Cover and turn down the heat to minimum and let all the water soak in (10 minutes or so) by being cautious as to not lift the lid meanwhile. Once the water is fully absorbed, stir and fluff up the rice, cover it and set it aside for a few extra minutes.
